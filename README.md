## Prerequisites

- Optional, required for PDF output: Google Chrome or Chromium

## Usage

### Generate English Version of CV
1. Download [resume_english.py](resume_english.py) and
   [resume_english.css](resume_english.css) and [resume_with_avatar_english.py](resume_with_avatar_english.py) (or make a copy of this repository, forking, or
   cloning).
2. Edit [resume_english.md](resume_english.md) (the placeholder text is taken
   with thanks from
   the [JSON Resume Project](https://jsonresume.org/themes/))

    * Use `--no-html` or `--no-pdf` to disable HTML or PDF output.
    * Use `--chrome-path=/path/to/chrome` if resume.py cannot find your Chrome
      or Chromium executable.

## Customization

Edit [resume_english.css](resume_english.css) to change the appearance of your english resume. and
edit [resume_german.css](resume_german.css) to change the appearance of your German resume. The
default style is extremely generic, which is perhaps what you want in a resume,
but CSS gives you a lot of flexibility. See, e.g. [The Tech Resume
Inside-Out](https://www.thetechinterview.com/) for good advice about what a
resume should look like (and what it should say).

Change the appearance of the PDF version (without affecting the HTML version) by
adding rules under the `@media print` CSS selector.

Change the margins and paper size of the PDF version by editing the [`@page` CSS
rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%40page/size).
